# auth_config.py
"""
Manages JWT (JSON Web Token) configuration and secret key storage.

This module provides a secure and automated way to handle the application's
secret key. The key is stored in the operating system's native credential
store (keyring) for enhanced security.

Features:
- On first import, it automatically generates a cryptographically secure
  secret key if one does not already exist in the keyring.
- Retrieves the existing key on subsequent imports.
- Provides a command-line utility to manually view or overwrite the key.

To manage the key manually, run this file from your terminal:
  python auth_config.py
